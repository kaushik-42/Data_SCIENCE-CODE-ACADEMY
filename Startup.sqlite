*****Trends in Startups******
Howdy! Itâ€™s your first day as a TechCrunch reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.

To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a project.sqlite file that contains a table called startups. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.

Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.

SELECT *
FROM startups;
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM startups;
SELECT SUM(valuation)
FROM startups;
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups;
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups
WHERE stage=='Seed';
SELECT MIN(founded)
FROM startups;
SELECT AVG(valuation)
FROM startups;
SELECT category, AVG(valuation)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location;
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
